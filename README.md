<img src="images/noteTaker.png" alt="Deployed app">

This app allows the user to create, edit and delete notes

The user can create a new note with a button, include a title and a body, then through a save button store it.

The user can then click on an delete button and the note will be erased from the stored notes.

The technologies behind it are node and express that are used to create a local server and API and HTML routes to manage GET, POST and DELETE requests</p>
